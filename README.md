-The game runs entirely in the console at this point.  Initialize the game by typing "game()" into your browser's console
-computerPlay() returns the computer's selection with a random number generater
-playerPrompt() has the user input their selection each round
-playRound() calls on computerPlay() and playerPrompt() to source new choices each round   and then compares the options to return win, lose, or draw
-game() loops 5 times, calling on playRound() each time to produce a new round outcome     and updates the scores for each round.  After 5 rounds, it outputs the overall winner    with score comparison, and requests the user to refresh their page
